## The Body Imprint

In the sacred Bumthang Valley — Bhutan's spiritual heartland — stands a temple complex built around one of the most tangible relics of Padmasambhava's presence: his body imprint pressed into solid rock.

The name **Kurje** means "body imprint" (ku = body, je = imprint). According to tradition, when Guru Rinpoche meditated in a cave here in the 8th century, the power of his realization was so great that his body left a permanent impression in the rock. This imprint can still be seen today, drawing pilgrims who touch the rock and receive blessing from direct contact with the master's presence.

## Padmasambhava in Bumthang

The story of Kurje begins with **King Sindhu Raja**, the local ruler who was gravely ill. His son invited Padmasambhava to heal the king, and Guru Rinpoche came to Bumthang.

The illness was caused by a powerful local deity who had been offended. Rather than simply defeat this being, Padmasambhava transformed into his wrathful form, **Dorje Drolo**, and subdued the deity, binding it as a protector of dharma. He then meditated in the cave, leaving his body imprint, and healed the king.

This pattern — subduing local spirits and transforming them into protectors — repeated throughout Padmasambhava's travels. At Kurje, the evidence of his power remains visible in the rock itself.

## The Three Temples

The complex contains three main temples:

**The First Temple**: Built in 1652 around the sacred cave containing Guru Rinpoche's body imprint. This is the innermost sanctum, where pilgrims come to touch the imprint and receive blessing.

**The Second Temple**: Built in 1900, containing a large statue of Padmasambhava and images of the thousand Buddhas.

**The Third Temple**: The largest, built in the 1990s under the direction of the Queen Mother. Contains massive statues of Padmasambhava and his two consorts.

The complex also includes a row of 108 stupas and a large juniper tree said to have grown from Guru Rinpoche's walking stick.

## Pilgrimage Practice

Pilgrims to Kurje typically:

- **Enter the first temple** and view the body imprint in the rock, touching it with devotion
- **Circumambulate the complex**, passing the 108 stupas
- **Prostrate** at various points within the temples
- **Offer butter lamps** at the shrines
- **Meditate** in the peaceful grounds with views of the Bumthang Valley

The site is especially powerful during the **Kurje Tsechu**, when sacred mask dances bring the stories of Padmasambhava to life and thousands of Bhutanese gather for blessing.
