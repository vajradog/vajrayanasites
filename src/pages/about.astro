            This guide was created to serve pilgrims — whether they journey physically to sacred sites 
            or connect with them through study and practice. Our aim is to provide comprehensive, 
            accurate information about Vajrayana Buddhist power places, presented with the depth and 
            respect these sacred sites deserve.
          </p>

            The Vajrayana tradition places great emphasis on <strong class="text-gold-300">né</strong> (གནས) — 
            power places where realized masters have practiced and left their blessings. These sites are not 
            merely historical monuments but living sources of spiritual power, accessible to those who 
            approach them with faith and proper understanding.

        <div class="prose-sacred text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-6">
          <p>
            In the Buddhist understanding, pilgrimage is not tourism. It is a spiritual practice with 
            specific purposes and methods:
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-gold-200 mt-8 mb-4">Accumulating Merit</h3>
          <p>
            Visiting sacred sites, making offerings, and performing practices there creates positive karma 
            that supports spiritual development. The merit accumulated at power places is said to be 
            multiplied many times compared to ordinary locations.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-gold-200 mt-8 mb-4">Receiving Blessings</h3>
          <p>
            Places where great masters practiced retain their spiritual power. By visiting with faith, 
            pilgrims open themselves to receive the accumulated blessings of all who have practiced there.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-gold-200 mt-8 mb-4">Purifying Obscurations</h3>
          <p>
            The physical hardship of pilgrimage, combined with devotional practices performed at sacred 
            sites, helps purify the mental and karmic obscurations that prevent awakening.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-gold-200 mt-8 mb-4">Connecting with Lineage</h3>
          <p>
            By visiting sites associated with the masters of one's lineage, practitioners strengthen 
            their connection to the transmission that carries the dharma through time.

            The information in this guide draws from traditional Tibetan sources, historical records, 
            pilgrimage guides written by realized masters, and modern scholarship. Where accounts differ, 
            we have tried to present the traditional understanding while acknowledging variations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sacred sites have living histories — they change, are rebuilt, face destruction and renewal. 
            We strive to keep information current while honoring the timeless nature of the blessings 
            these places carry.
